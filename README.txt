Boulder Break was my second assignment for ENGGEN 131. He were given a very basic framework and were asked to write many functions to make the game playable.
The version submitted to my assgnment is boulder_break3. This version requires a user entry for each letter
After submitting the assignment, I decided to make some changes to the input methods
boulder_break4 moves the player character automatically, like in the classic game snake.
boulder_break5 automatically detects keypresses automatically and instantaneously updates the board. In my opinion, this is much more fun to play
